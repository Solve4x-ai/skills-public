# ui-check

Look at the real page, not the code, and catch what a person would trip over.

1. **Screenshot every page the change touches**, from the running app, with a headless browser script or the app's screenshot tool. Include the full page when it scrolls. Verify: no console errors were reported while it loaded.
2. **Check the states that matter:** empty, loading, one item, many items, an error, and a long name or value. Light and dark theme if the app has both, and a phone-width view (about 375 px).
3. **Look for the usual problems:**
   - the same action shown twice on one screen;
   - buttons or boxes stretched full width when they shouldn't be;
   - text overflowing, cut off, or wrapping awkwardly;
   - a long list burying what matters (fold the noise behind a "show" link);
   - a dead end: a problem with no next step.
4. **Read every word** with the `plain-words` skill in mind.
5. **Fix, re-shoot, compare.** Repeat until clean, then report what you looked at.

## gotchas
- A passing test suite says nothing about layout. Only looking does.
- Formatting and CSS changes can move things on pages you didn't edit; shoot the neighbours too.
- Real data is messier than test data: try it against the busiest real account you're allowed to view.

## never
- Never call UI work done without having looked at it.
- Never test against production data in a way that changes it; use read-only views or a test account.
